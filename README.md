# scaffolding

This repository contains scaffolding to make standing up a full sigstore stack
easier and automatable. Our focus is on running on Kubernetes and rely on
several primitives provided by k8s as well as some semantics.

# Quickstart

If you do not care about the nitty gritty details and just want to stand up a
local stack, check out the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md)
If you want to just run sigstore in your GitHub actions, check out the
[actions](./actions/setup/README.md). If you want to stand up a sigstore
stack on GCP using Terraform, we also got you [covered there](./terraform/).

# Background

Currently in various e2e tests we (the community) do not exercise all the
components of the Sigstore when running tests. This results in us skipping
some validation tests (for example, but not limited to, –insecure-skip-verify
flag), or using public instances for some of the tests. Part of the reason is
that there are currently some manual steps or some assumptions baked in some
places that make this trickier than is strictly necessary. This repository is
meant to make it easier to test projects that utilize sigstore by making it easy
to spin up a whole sigstore stack in a k8s cluster so that you can do proper
integration testing.

If you are interested in figuring out the nitty/gritty manual way of standing
up a sigstore stack, a wonderful very detailed document for standing all the
pieces from scratch is given in Luke Hinds’
“[Sigstore the hard way](https://github.com/lukehinds/sigstore-the-hard-way)”



# Overview

This document is meant to describe what pieces have been built and why. The
goals are to be able to stand up a fully functional setup suitable for k8s
clusters, including KinD, which various projects use in our GitHub actions for
integration testing.

Because we assume k8s is the environment that we run in, we make use of a
couple of concepts provided by it that make automation easier.


* [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) - Run to completion abstraction. Creates pods, if they fail, will recreate until it succeeds, or finally gives up.
* [ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) - Hold arbitrary configuration information
* [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) - Hold secrety information, but care must be taken for these to actually be secret

By utilizing the Jobs “run to completion” properties, we can construct “gates”
in our automation, which allows us to not proceed until a Job completes
successfully (“full speed ahead”) or fails (fail the test setup and bail). These
take a form of using kubectl wait command, for example, waiting for jobs in
‘mynamespace’ to complete within 5 minutes or fail.:

```
kubectl wait --timeout 5m -n mynamespace --for=condition=Complete jobs --all
```

Another k8s concept we utilize is the ability to mount both ConfigMaps and
Secrets into Pods. Furthermore, if a ConfigMap or Secret (and more granularly a
‘key’ in either, but it’s not important) is not available, the Pod will block
starting. This naturally gives us another “gate” which allows us to deploy
components and rely on k8s to reconcile to a known good state (or fail if it can
not be accomplished).

# Components

Here’s a high level overview of the components in play that we would like to be
able to spin up with the lines depicting dependencies. Later on in the document
we will cover each of these components in detail, starting from the “bottom up”.

![alt_text](./sigstore-architecture.png "image_tooltip")

## [Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian)

Trillian requires a database to work, so we create one using Trillian CI
[container](gcr.io/trillian-opensource-ci/db_server@sha256:e58334fead37d1f03c77c80f66008966e79739d85214b373b3c0a69f97c59359)
that has the mysql running, and Trillian
[schema](https://github.com/google/trillian/blob/master/storage/mysql/schema/storage.sql) on it.

## [Rekor](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor)

Rekor requires a Merkle tree that has been created in Trillian to function. This
can be achieved by using the admin grpc client
[CreateTree](https://github.com/google/trillian/blob/master/trillian_admin_api.proto#L49)
call. This again is a Job ‘**createtree**’ and this job will also create a
ConfigMap containing the newly minted TreeID. This allows us to (recall mounting
Configmaps to pods from above) to block Rekor server from starting before the
TreeID has been provisioned. So, assuming that Rekor runs in Namespace
rekor-system and the ConfigMap that is created by ‘**createtree**’ Job, we can
have the following (some stuff omitted for readability) in our Rekor Deployment
to ensure that Rekor will not start prior to TreeID having been properly
provisioned.


```
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: rekor
        image: gcr.io/projectsigstore/rekor-server@sha256:516651575db19412c94d4260349a84a9c30b37b5d2635232fba669262c5cbfa6
        args: [
          "serve",
          "--trillian_log_server.address=log-server.trillian-system.svc",
          "--trillian_log_server.port=80",
          "--trillian_log_server.tlog_id=$(TREE_ID)",
        ]
        env:
        - name: TREE_ID
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: rekor-config
              key: treeID

```



## [CTLog](https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go)

CTLog is the first piece in the puzzle that requires a bit more wrangling
because it actually has a dependency on Trillian as well as Fulcio (more about
Fulcio details later).

For Trillian, we just need to create another TreeID, but we’re reusing the
same ‘**createtree**’ Job from above.

In addition to Trillian, the dependency on Fulcio is that we need to establish
trust for the Root Certificate that Fulcio is using so that when Fulcio sends
requests for inclusion in our CTLog, we trust it. For this, we use
[RootCert](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/blob/main/pkg/api/client.go#L132)
API call to fetch the Certificate.

Lastly we need to create a Certificate for CTLog itself.

So in addition to ‘**createtree**’ Job, we also have a ‘**createctconfig**’ Job
that will fail to make progress until TreeID has been populated in the ConfigMap
by the ‘**createtree**’ call above. Once the TreeID has been created, it will
try to fetch a Fulcio Root Certificate (again, failing until it becomes
available). Once the Fulcio Root Certificate is retrieved, the Job will then
create a Public/Private keys to be used by the CTLog service and will write the
following two Secrets (names can be changed ofc):

* ctlog-secrets - Holds the public/private keys for CTLog as well as Root Certificate for Fulcio in the following keys:
    * private - CTLog private key
    * public - CTLog public key
    * rootca - Fulcio Root Certificate
* ctlog-public-key - Holds the public key for CTLog so that clients calling Fulcio will able to verify the SCT that they receive from Fulcio.

In addition to the Secrets above, the Job will also add a new entry into the
ConfigMap (now that I write this, it could just as well go in the secrets above
I think…) created by the ‘**createtree**’ above. This entry is called ‘config’
and it’s a serialized ProtoBuf required by the CTLog to start up.

Again by using the fact that the Pod will not start until all the required
ConfigMaps / Secrets are available, we can configure the CTLog deployment to
block until everything is available. Again for brevity some things have been
left out, but the CTLog configuration would look like so:

```
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: ctfe
          image: ko://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/trillian/ctfe/ct_server
          args: [
            "--http_endpoint=0.0.0.0:6962",
            "--log_config=/ctfe-config/ct_server.cfg",
            "--alsologtostderr"
          ]
          volumeMounts:
          - name: keys
            mountPath: "/ctfe-keys"
            readOnly: true
          - name: config
            mountPath: "/ctfe-config"
            readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: keys
          secret:
            secretName: ctlog-secret
            items:
            - key: private
              path: privkey.pem
            - key: public
              path: pubkey.pem
            - key: rootca
              path: roots.pem
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: ctlog-config
            items:
            - key: config
              path: ct_server.cfg

```


Here instead of mounting into environmental variables, we must mount to the
filesystem given how the CTLog expects these things to be materialized.

Ok, so with the ‘**createtree**’ and ‘**createctconfig**’ jobs having successfully
completed, CTLog will happily start up and be ready to serve requests. Again if
it fails, tests will fail and the logs will contain information about the
particular failure.

Also, the reason why the public key was created in a different secret is because
clients will need access to this key because they need that public key to verify
the SCT returned by the Fulcio to ensure it actually was properly signed.

## Fulcio

Make it stop!!! Is there more??? Last one, I promise… For Fulcio we just need to
create a Root Certificate that it will use to sign incoming Signing Certificate
requests. For this we again have a Job ‘**createcerts**’ that will create a self
signed certificate, private/public keys as well as password used to encrypt the
private key.
Basically we need to ensure we have all the
[necessary pieces](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/blob/main/cmd/app/serve.go#L63-L65)
to start up Fulcio.

This ‘**createcerts**’ job just creates the pieces mentioned above and creates
a Secret containing the following keys:

* cert - Root Certificate
* private - Private key
* password - Password to use for decrypting the private key
* public - Public key

And as seen already above, we modify the Deployment to not start the Pod until
all the pieces are available, making our Deployment of Fulcio look (simplified
again) like this.


```
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/projectsigstore/fulcio@sha256:66870bd6b111f3c5478703a8fb31c062003f0127b2c2c5e49ccd82abc4ec7841
        name: fulcio
        args:
          - "serve"
          - "--port=5555"
          - "--ca=fileca"
          - "--fileca-key"
          - "/var/run/fulcio-secrets/key.pem"
          - "--fileca-cert"
          - "/var/run/fulcio-secrets/cert.pem"
          - "--fileca-key-passwd"
          - "$(PASSWORD)"
          - "--ct-log-url=http://ctlog.ctlog-system.svc/e2e-test-tree"
        env:
        - name: PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: fulcio-secret
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - name: fulcio-cert
          mountPath: "/var/run/fulcio-secrets"
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: fulcio-cert
        secret:
          secretName: fulcio-secret
          items:
          - key: private
            path: key.pem
          - key: cert
            path: cert.pem

```

# Other rando stuff

This document focused on the Tree management, Certificate, Key and such creation
automagically, coordinating the interactions and focusing on the fact that no
manual intervention is required at any point during the deployment and relying
on k8s primitives and semantics. If you need any customization of where things
live, or control any knobs, you might want to look at the
[helm charts](https://github.com/sigstore/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/scaffold)
that wrap this repo in a more customizable way.
